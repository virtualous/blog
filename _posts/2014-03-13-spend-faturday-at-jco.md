<em>I ended up eating five and a half of seven. </em>

Last year I went on a strict no carbohydrate and sugar diet. During my cheat days I'd invite a friend to join me pig out on cards and sugar. 

J CO is a famous doughnut and coffee place. It always has a long line every time we pass by. 

For this Faturday I'm joined by Cj one of my friends from work since five years ago. 

Because it was faturday, I asked one of the makers which had the highest calories. It was avocado,&nbsp; creme brulé, chocolate and one of the cheesecakes. See the box for reference. 

Some of my friends complain that JCo donuts are light as if filled with air and I like that it's super soft and absolutely delicious.
