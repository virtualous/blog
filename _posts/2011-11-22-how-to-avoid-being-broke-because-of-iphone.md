I met a lot of friends who were super excited when the iPhone came out. Unfortunately as soon as they made the purchase they became short on cash because a lot of them paid an arm or a leg and in some cases both to get one. The typical Filipino worker earns an average of 15,000php - 35,000 php per month and if you spent 40,000php for an iPhone upfront or about 3,000php per month in installment that's oing to hurt your budget.

But I want an iPhone!

I do too. So it took me a while to figure out the answer. I considered buying second hand but I have trust issues when buying electronics and besides paying 10k-15k for an iPhone 3g or paying 13k-18k for an iPhone 3gs is a bit steep and I doubt I could get a good deal on installment. An iPhone 4 at the time I wrote this is still around 30k and 25k for second hand. After trying out the retina display I no longer felt like wanting to pay for an iPhone, iPhone 3g or iPhone 3gs.

Speaking of second hand deals.

What if you got an offer from your friend to buy an iPhone at a third of the price?

The condition of the iPhone is brand new.

It comes with iOS and is compatible with iOS5 so you'll have access to most of the 500,000 iPhone apps.

You got retina display for the world's coolest pocket computer.

It's a super slim iPhone prototype.

You can buy it for a third of the price.

It just has a few hardware problems:
The manifacturer tried to build a super slim version that they forgot to consider adding space for a sim card slot.
They attached the iPhone 4s' front facing camera to the front and the rear of the iPhone since most people use the fron facing camera most of the time they thought it'd be twice the fun. Uhmmmm. Okay. I probably would use the front facing camera to take pictures of myself most of the time anyway.

Is that all? That doesn't sound so bad.

How much different is your iPod touch from your iPhone? Not much really. I've been playing around with iPhone4's for a few months now and I can't tell the difference except for the weight because my version is much much lighter.

How to I use my<del> iPhone</del> I mean iPod Touch?
<blockquote>

	<li>I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5368294/top-10-ways-to-get-more-from-a-cameraphone">use the camera a lot</a>. (Like a scanner, extending my brain and for fun)</li>
	<li>Here are some <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/10/how-to-take-better-pictures-with-your-phones-camera/">tips to improve your shots</a>.</li>
	<li>I use the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idonethis/id456486471?mt=8">idonethis app</a> by <a href="http://idonethis.com">idonethis.com</a> as a logbook, inspiration journal, a list of accomplishments and a whole bunch of things. (Must check out)</li>

</blockquote>
Despite all that there are limitations but here's how to make the most of it:
Use your mobile phone to call and text.
Take camera's in good lighting. Daytime shots are great.
Go online through a wifi hotspot.
Use face time and iMessage to call and text other iPhones, iPads, iPod touch's.
Buy a rear case. (Really Really important I don't care how careful you are)
Get free paid apps by downloading app shopper.

That's my solution for iPhone envy. What's yours?
