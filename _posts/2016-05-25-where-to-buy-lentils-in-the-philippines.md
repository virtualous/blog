Lentils are my staple for the slow carb diet. I find it difficult to find them. So I take note of where I can get them. I prefer buying Dry lentils. They cook quickly and are easy to store. They are also cheaper than the canned variants. I previously bought mine from Shopwise. After a year they stopped selling it. They only have the canned lentils from Molinera which are Php 50 a can. I use these for food emergencies but it's not practical to eat every day. Since then, I've been keeping an eye out on where I might be able to buy more lentils.

<strong>SM Supermarket</strong>

You can find lentils at SM supermarket but not all SM supermarket have them.
You can get dry quick cook lentils and canned lentils from Molinera.

I get mine right now from Sm Bf.

<strong>Indian stores</strong>. There's an Indian store I'm Makati that has lentils. It's a little more expensive but the advantage is they have brown and yellow lentils.

<em>Assad Mini Mart Indian Grocery Store </em>
<em>Same building as top grill. Eurocrest Building Jupiter Street Makati.</em>

<strong>Santis delicatessen</strong>. This is the most expensive option. I don't buy lentils from here often but what I like about the lentils at Santis is the puy lentils which are small.

Here's the address to the main branch. This is also the place I go to often. They have the widest selection.

<em>7431 Yakal Street, San Antonio Village, Makati City, Philippines </em>
<em>Tel: 840-3771 to 82</em>

Here's a <a href="http://www.werdenberg.com/santis/store.html">link to all the Santis store locations</a>.

Do you also have a place you get lentils from for cheap that I didn't mention. Share it in the comments below.
