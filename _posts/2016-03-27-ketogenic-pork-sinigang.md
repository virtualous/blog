I'm from the Philippines and I'm having trouble implementing the slow carb diet and the Ketogenic diet. I'm experimenting ketogenic friendly meals.

This week I'm testing the sustainability of pork sinigang as a meal.

Ingredients 
Pork cubes or belly. 
Raddish 
Onions 
Tamarind 
Spinach instead of Kang Kong

Cook the meat with the Tamarind and onions until tender. Add the Raddish then the spinach.

Add into your your packed lunch containers and refrigerate.

Enjoy.
