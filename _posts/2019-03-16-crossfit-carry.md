If you're new to CrossFit and don't know what to bring here's a really short list.


**1. Water**

I typically use between 500ml to a full liter of water. If I'm packing light, I only bring 500ml and buy the rest at the CrossFit box.


**2. Change of Clothes**

If you're heading out and going home immediately after your workout you may only want a change of shirt. If you have an apointment after your CrossFit workout, you want a full change of clothes.


**3. Toiletries**

You'll probably need some tissue, wet wipes and if you're using the shower room, bring a towel, soap, shampoo and/or conditioner as well as deodorant.

If you are looking for a CrossFit box in BF Para√±aque, visit [PR City](http://prcitycf.com/).

They are open in the morning with a 7am and a 9am class and a pm class that includes 5pm, 6pm, 7pm and 8pm.
