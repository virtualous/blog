I just bought an iPad. It was on sale and I've wanted one for the longest time and I mastered using it by borrowing other people's devices and I finally bought one. I also wanted to avoid using my laptop to give way to my younger brother and still get to publish my posts on the blog. 

I've been feeling lazy lately and I noticed that I've been eating out more and the food choices that I'm picking is quite unhealthy. I need a change. I found out from an old podcast that I've downloaded that my favorite celebrity chef Jamie Oliver rarely had food made for him and he's campaigning alternatives to consuming a "takeaway". 

Now I have two reasons to make my own meals. The first being my health and the second is I'm trying to cut on costs but I don't want to compromise of the quality of the food I'm eating. 

After church, I had a short bible study session with my friends over a meal at The Old Spaghetti house. I often look for inspiration for my meals when I eat out. This time, I want something simple and cheap that I can make really quick. I ordered the Vietnamese Garlic pasta. 

Here's what you need:
<ul>
	<li>Pasta</li>
	<li>Olive Oil</li>
	<li>Finely Chopped Garlic</li>
	<li>salt and pepper</li>
	<li>your choice of coriander,basil or parsley</li>
</ul>
Lets get started!
<ol>
	<li>Cook the pasta in salted boiling water. </li>
	<li>Sauté the garlic in olive oil until golden brown then add the cook pasta. Mix everything in. Transfer to plate. </li>
	<li>Top with herbs. </li>
</ol>

Simple right? Here's a picture to show you what it looks like.
