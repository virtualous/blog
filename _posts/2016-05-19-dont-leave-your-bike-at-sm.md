Don't leave your bike at SM. 

It is the worst place to leave your bike. 

My bike got stolen there. 

It was chained and parked in front of the guard. 

The guard just said they didn't see anything. 

It was stolen and the Mall of Asia bike parking.

Previously my bike lights got stolen. 

This happened in SM Bicutan.

This also happened in front of the parking fee collectors booth.

The guards acted like nothing happened.
