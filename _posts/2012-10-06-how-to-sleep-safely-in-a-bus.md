I normally recommend staying awake through out most bus trips especially if you're alone. There are times though that you will have to take a five or ten minute nap on a bus because you stayed up late partying the night before.

I have done it several times at first, with fear but after a few more times I think I could sleep on a bus safely when I need to. Here are some of my tips.

<strong>Pick a good seatmate</strong> - I normally pick someone cute to sit with so I have someone to talk to if ever I get bored. The other real reason is I don't want to keep my guard up for pick pockets all the time so I often sit next to cute girls, nice old ladies or whatever that feels safe. I know it's bad to judge seat mates based on appearance but it has worked for me so far.

<strong>Take the window seat</strong> - If I'm alone I normally take the window seat and I try to sit next to nobody if I can't find a good seatmate.

<strong>Put your valuables against the wall and leave your open pockets empty</strong>. When I say open, I mean pockets you can’t guard with your hand. When I get myself a window seat I discreetly move my phone and my cash on the side that's against the wall/closed window. That way I can take a nap with my arm or hand covering my valuables all the time and it is next to impossible to take my stuff without me knowing.

<strong>Know your destination</strong> - It's a pain to take another bus back after waking up to find out that you missed your destination. You better have a good estimate of the travel time or ask the conductor or driver (if you're seated near him) to wake you if you're near your destination. I also recommend doing it twice as sometimes they tend to forget. I also recommend moving closer to the exit whenever you can.

Do you also sleep on the bus? Feel free to share your tips in the comments below.
