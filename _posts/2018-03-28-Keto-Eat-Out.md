One challenge of the ketogenic diet is eating out. 

Filipinos love rice and eating rice is expected.

It's going to take a little trial and error but with a little patience you can get used to eating out in the Philippines on a Ketogenic diet.

Here are some tips and suggestions to eating out and following the rules of the ketogenic diet in the Philippines

### Rules I follow to Eating Keto in the Philippines

1. If you notice that the sauce is a little sweet, don't eat all of it. Just consume the meat part.
2. Get used to eating the same meals.
3. Explore until you find Keto meals.


### Eatery Suggestions Mainstream

1. Pork Sinigang. (Don't eat the gabi)
2. Bulalo, Nilaga and Tinola.
3. Kaldereta (Don't eat the potato)
4. Beef or Pork Steak
5. Chicken or Pork Adobo (Get extra eggs if you can)
6. Afritada (Don't eat the potato)
7. Lechon Kawali
8. Eggs are your friend. Get fried eggs, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, balut, etc.
